# Sokoban Game :gift: :pager:

Sokoban puzzle game written in C++, the objective is to move all crates to correct locations.

## Description

First published in December 1982, Sokoban is a game in which you are a warehouse employee who has to move crates around onto specific targets.  This project was originally part of a coding course in university.  I recreated the game with the SFML graphics library.
